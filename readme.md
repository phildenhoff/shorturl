# shorturl

Loosely based on @xmonader's [Day 7 of Nim days](https://xmonader.github.io/nimdays/day07_shorturl.html).

This is a url shortening website that takes input website URLs like "https://google.com/search?q=your%20favourite%20website" and distills them down into tiny links like "https://goo.gl/a7fv31".

## Differences from "Nim days"

Databases have their value, but I didn't feel like setting one up. So, first
off, I removed the dependency on SQLite. Unfortunately, I didn't add back in
preservation of the IDs onto disk, so right now it's all stored in memory in
a map (what Nim calls a "table"). Spooooooky ðŸ‘»

Because I removed SQLite, I also (apparently?) removed the method for
generating IDs for each URL -- it seems like it was generated implcitly by
SQLite, which I'm pretty sure is bad practice, but oh well. To generate the
short paths, I MD5 hashed the request URL plus the current system time in
milliseconds, and took the last 5 characters. I only added the time since I
didn't like the idea of URLs having the same mapping to an ID for all time;
each URL can only be in the map once.

I thought it was pretty hacky to shove a 50+ line HTML page into a Nim source
file, so I moved that into its own file and created `PathFileBackings` to
enumerate valid files for resources paths (e.g. "index.html" for the `/`
route) and `getPageContent` to get the content of each of those pages at
request time. It would be nice to change this in the future so that the
server pre-caches all files into memory at startup and then occasionally
reviews the file backings for changes, but atm that's more work that it's
worth.

Speaking of HTML, I also added a 404 page (it's very basic) and removed the
accidental "submit" feature of the Enter key in the form. Now, if you press
Enter, you just get the shortened URL. Yay! ðŸŽ‰
